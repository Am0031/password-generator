# Password generator

## What is this project about?

HTML and CSS code is already provided and is not to be modified.
Only the Javascript code is to be developed so that the steps to generate a password are in place, and the password appears on the page.
The user is to be prompted to enter the password length of their choice within an accepted range, and to decide for each group of character whether they want to use them for the generation of the password.
